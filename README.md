# Introduction

**JJ65c02** is my own personal interpretation of the noteworthy [Ben Eaters 6502 Computer](https://eater.net/6502) setup. In addition to Ben's work, I've used code, concepts and inspiration from a number of people, all acknowledged below in the **Credits** section.

This project contains 3 main sections:

* The actual JJ65c02 breadboard computer ([Schematics](./Schematics))
* [Software](./Software)
  * The ROM bootloader
  * Arduino code
  * Host code
  * x65c02 Emulator
* [Datasheets](./Datasheets)

The Software itself is my fork of the open source codebases mentioned above, with changes due to improvements, modifications required due to the specifics of the JJ65c02 setup (as compared to the BE6502), and bug fixes.

Each section has its own Readme.md and Folder under this repo.
