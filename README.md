# Introduction

**JJ65c02** is my own personal interpretation of the noteworthy [Ben Eaters 6502 Computer](https://eater.net/6502) setup. In addition to Ben's work, I've used code, concepts and inspiration from a number of people, all acknowledged below in the **Credits** section.

This project contains 3 main sections:

* The actual JJ65c02 breadboard computer ([Schematics](./Schematics))
* [Software](./Software)
  * The miniOS ROM bootloader
  * x65c02 Emulator
* [Datasheets](./Datasheets)

The Software itself is my fork of the open source codebases mentioned above, with changes due to improvements, modifications required due to the specifics of the JJ65c02 setup (as compared to the BE6502), and bug fixes.

Each section has its own Readme.md and Folder under this repo.

# Keep up to date by reading the [History](./HISTORY.md) file, which serves as a running log of additions and improvements.

# Pull Requests

If you would like to see any particular feature I would be happy to accept any actual code contributions via Pull Requests, or even Enhancement requests. I am happy to screen, test and merge any valuable PR.

# Contact

You can, of course, contact me via the normal Github development methods, such as Issues, Pull Requests, etc. You can also ping me via [Email](mailto:jimjag@gmail.com) and follow me/DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jimjag/)
