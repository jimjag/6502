# x6502
This is a fork of the original x6502 project that implements full support for the WDC 65c02 instruction set. I have also removed some of the things that I don't personally care for such as the debug functionality, the `ext` opcode (which is redundant with the `stp` opcode), the `stdlib` and `sample_programs`.

## License
x6502 is freely available under the original 4-clause BSD license, the full text of which is included in the LICENSE file.

## Thanks
Thanks to haldean and all other contributors for the original x6502 project!
